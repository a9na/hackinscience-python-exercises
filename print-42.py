# In this exercise you'll learn to use a function by trying the print builtin function.
# A function is a named thing that does something specific:
# the print function displays what's given to it,
# the len function measures the thing we give to it,
# â€¦
# The syntax to make a function work is called a "function call", to make print display the string "Hello world" the syntax is:
# print("Hello world")

number=42
print(number)
